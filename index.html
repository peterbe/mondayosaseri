<h2>The Story</h2>


<ul>
<li>I moved out of one of Monday Osaseri's properties in south London on the <strong>25th of October 2011</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>I always paid rent on time without fail</strong> including the last month's rent.</li>
<li>On the 31st of October 2011 <strong>I sent an email detailing that all utility bills and council tax has been fully paid and settled</strong>.
  I also included a proof of the last months rent payment.</li>
<li>Since then I have <strong>never been contacted back</strong> by phone or email. </li>
<li>And he still <strong>owes me &pound;1410.00</strong> which is the deposit I paid when I moved in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More evidence of neglect and anti-social behaviour</h2>

<p>Since having submitted all details to settle the deposit I have now <strong>sent more than 10 emails</strong> and LinkedIn messages. I have <strong>called more than 30 times</strong>
and sent numerous text messages urging him to contact me back. He has answered the phone three times:</p>

<ol>
<li>Once, he said he needed the Lease Agreement by email (which he should already have)</li>
<li>Once he pretended he couldn't hear me and hung up</li>
<li>Once he said "Did you not receive my email?" and hung up (which he hasn't, and I have checked my spam folder)</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, during the time as his tenant, there were numerous accounts of maltreatment.<br>
When I moved in the washing machine was broken and it took two and half weeks to get it fixed. 
No apology was made or offer of compensation in any form.</p>

<p>When the kitch sink started leaking, it took two weeks to even get a response on calls to get this fixed. 
Again, no apology was made or offer of compensation in any form.</p>

<p>When I moved in, it took over a month to get a letter box key so that I can receive
mail which was something I needed as a proof of address for other reasons. 
Again, no apology was made or offer of compensation in any form.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The word "Property" is spelled "Property" and "Properties" in plural. Not "propertes"! <br>
Such obvious spelling mistakes indicate that he is not taking his business seriously.</p>
